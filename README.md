# GEN AI SUITE ⚡️

This repository contains the development of a ChatGPT clone built using Ruby on Rails. The platform will feature an AI-powered chat interface, image recognition, and integration with various generative AI models.

The project is designed to be deployed and will leverage cloud-based solutions such as AWS or Google Cloud for scalability, performance, and security. The goal is to create a robust and interactive generative AI experience that combines text and image capabilities, all powered by modern AI technologies.

Stay tuned for updates on deployment strategies and further features

## Coming soon
Currently, the application is only designed to support ai-chatting. With the development of future states, image recognition and other generative AI capabilities will be added.
